# UniverseLib

UniverseLib is a library for making plugins which target IL2CPP and Mono Unity games, with a focus on UI-driven plugins.

## This fork

This version of the library has been modified for use in [DON'T CALL ABIGAIL](https://github.com/dont-call-abigail).

In particular, it has been configured to better conform to our build system, and BepInEx is the only supported target.

## Documentation

Documentation and usage guides can currently be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UniverseLib/wiki).

## UniverseLib.Analyzers

The Analyzers package is not supported by this fork.
